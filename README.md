# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to audit the tabulated results of the US Congressional Election. We have to calculate the total
number of votes, number of votes for each candidate in different counites and the percentage and finally the winner for the election. 
The voting data was genarated from mail in ballots, punch cards and direct recording electronic machines. We have been provided with 
all the data in Excel but to retrieve data more efficiently we will be using visual studio. 

## Election-Audit Results
* The total number of votes casted in the electon were 369,711
* The number of votes for each county and the percentage is as follows
   * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
   * Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
   * Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

## Election-Audit Summary
The script used in this project is very detailed and provides summary of the reults we are looking for very efficiently. 
This script can be used for any type of election let it be on a district level, state level or nation wide level. Few things
that can be modified in this are:
  * We can determine districts to reflect the political choices of voters on a district level election.
  * For a presidential run we can determine votes by voters choice per every state. 
The result of both these modifications can provide a very detailed overview which would reflect political choices of 
voters on a district level which eventually would reflect the result on a state level. If these polls were to run before
the actual election, it could give the election comission and the  candidate a chance of how weak or strong they are in 
a particular district or state. Eventually this would all contribute to getting the most accuarte result.
